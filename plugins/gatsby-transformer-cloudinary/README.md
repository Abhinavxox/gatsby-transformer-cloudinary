# gatsby-transformer-cloudinary

## TODO

- [ ] Add fragments
- [ ] Add transformation arguments
- [ ] Add support for fixed and fluid

## Open Questions

1. Does it cost credit to reupload the same image on build?

We only want to update images if theyâ€™ve changed. Does Cloudinary have a way to auto-detect that?

2. What the hell does "sizes" do?

3. Will Remark plugins be able to use this transformer?

4. Is there a convenience method for MDX?

5. How do we add top-level transformation args?
